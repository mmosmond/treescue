% at least 27 yrs of theory on evol rescue: we know a lot about when and how rescue should occur
% a large and quickly growing number of experiments of increasing complexity and detail: verifying theory and discovering additional factors
% many examples of drug resistance, eg HIV, in asexual microbes: stressing an applied need to understand rescue for human health
% a big question that remains is: how common is rescue in wild sexual species? conservation angle
% evidence of the excitement around this question: a recent spike in claims for rescue in wild sexual species (amaranthus, killifish, arabidopsis, bats, etc) 
% however, still unclear how confidently we can identify rescue from (predominately) contemporary genetic data
% this is a new direction for rescue theory

% coalescent framework for detecting selection and demography
% work with Coop on signatures of rescue: difficult/impossible to differentiate sweep+bottleneck from any data, but especially summary statistics?

% what if we could see the coalecent trees themselves? does that give us more power to detect rescue?
% arabidopsis example: used the trees, found bottleneck and sweeps but remains unclear how well their methodology can pick up rescue
% run simulations of rescue, infer trees, infer demography and selection -- can we detect rescue?
